## 🔧 How It Works

### Sign-In Flow
```
User clicks "Continue with Google"
    ↓
Firebase signInWithPopup()
    ↓
Success? → Store user in context → Close modal
    ↓
Error: unauthorized-domain?
    ↓
Create demo user → Store in context → Show toast
    ↓
Other errors? → Show error message
```

### Session Persistence
```
Page loads
    ↓
UserContext checks Firebase auth state
    ↓
User logged in? → Load user data
    ↓
No user? → Show landing page
    ↓
User navigates → Context maintains state
    ↓
Page refresh → Firebase restores session
```

### Demo Mode Activation
```
Firebase Error: auth/unauthorized-domain
    ↓
Console logs setup instructions
    ↓
Create demo user object:
  - uid: demo-user-[timestamp]
  - email: demo@usda.gov
  - displayName: Demo User
    ↓
Store in UserContext
    ↓
Toast: "Signed in with Demo User"
    ↓
Full access to all features
```
